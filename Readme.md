## 📌 Project Overview

**Neo-Inspect** is a Deep Learning based automated surface defect inspection system developed using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

The main objective of this project is to automatically detect and classify industrial surface defects from images. The CNN model learns important visual features from defect images and predicts the category of the surface defect with high efficiency.

This project implements core **Computer Vision and Deep Learning concepts** including image preprocessing, CNN architecture, feature extraction, training, validation, and image classification.

# 🔍 Defect Classes

The model can classify the following surface defects:

| Class           | Description               |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Crazing         | Surface cracks pattern    |
| Inclusion       | Foreign material defects  |
| Patches         | Irregular surface patches |
| Pitted Surface  | Small holes or pits       |
| Rolled In Scale | Rolling process defects   |
| Scratches       | Surface scratches         |
